    /**
     * Time Complexity of previousPermutation:
     * The time complexity of the previousPermutation solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
     * This is because we have to find the rightmost element that violates the descending order, swap elements, and reverse a portion of the array, all of which take linear time.
     * Space Complexity of previousPermutation:
     * - The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the array in place and not using any additional data structures that depend on the input size.
     *
     *
     *
     * Intuition:
     * - The goal is to find the largest permutation that is smaller than the current one.
     * - To do this, we need to identify the first position (from right to left) where the order is not descendingâ€”this indicates the point where a reduction in value can occur.
     * - By swapping this element with the largest value to its right that is smaller than itself, we ensure the permutation is the next smallest.
     * - Finally, reversing the order of elements to the right creates the largest possible permutation for these elements, making it the correct previous permutation.
